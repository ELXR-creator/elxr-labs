>Experiment. Fail. Learn. Repeat.

elxr-labs is the research and learning sandbox of the ELXR ecosystem - a controlled environment for testing ideas ,building intuition and exploring new technologies before they evolve into production grade systems. 

## Purpose
 - To learn, prototype, and document your technical growth.

 - To test algorithms, libraries, APIs, and frameworks.

 - To build intuition around data structures, machine learning, and distributed systems.

 - To serve as a bridge between idea → implementation → integration.


 ## Workflow

 - Prototype here. Try things, break them, and document what you learned.

 - Refine your logic. Once something is stable or reusable, extract it to elxr-core.

 - Integrate your insights. Use the refined tools in pipelines, ML, or app projects.
